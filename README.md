Simple examples of programs written in Go.

1. Simple JSON webserver in Go

2. Showing concurrent execution with goroutines

3. Send a message between two goroutines using a channel and the ```select``` statement

4. Simple reverse proxy using the standard lib.

[Really good resource of explained Go examples. Shamelessly stealing code from this for my own sake.](https://gobyexample.com/)

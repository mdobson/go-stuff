Simple examples of programs written in Go.

1. Simple JSON webserver in Go

2. Showing concurrent execution with goroutines

3. Send message on channel and when we have one print it out and exit the program

[Really good resource of explained Go examples. Shamelessly stealing code from this for my own sake.](https://gobyexample.com/)
